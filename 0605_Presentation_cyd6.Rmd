## Interesting Data Visualization

<http://maps.tnc.org/migrations-in-motion/#4/43.29/-111.93>

> - Intriguing motion presentation (good for online)
> - Informational widget
> - Interactive map (maybe not as important due to regional confinement)

## Another Interesting Data Visualization

<http://research.google.com/bigpicture/music/>

> - Timeline aspect... could double up on Y-axis with wave sound amplitude and whale distance from sound both being represented
> - Wave visualization

## Next Steps for Visualizations

> 1. Determine variables to be presented
> 2. Better understand how to create live motion presentations (Can use geographic locations and time stamps to show movement...Sort through data and decide how long of a time frame should be presented... Maybe option to zoom through different time periods, similar to a weather radar?)
> 3. Do we have data for sound amplitude at different locations? Maybe this is something that can be physically calculated for visualization?
